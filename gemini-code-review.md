# Gemini Code Review

This document provides a code review of the `dsl-go` application.

## Project Overview

The `dsl-go` project is a Go-based application that defines, parses, and manages a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for orchestrating institutional client onboarding. The DSL uses S-expression syntax to define complex onboarding workflows, including entities, resources, and lifecycle states.

The application provides a command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the DSL, allowing users to create, generate, and validate onboarding requests.

## Key Components

- **`cmd/dsl-go/main.go`**: The entry point for the CLI application. It handles command-line arguments and orchestrates the application's functionality.
- **`internal/ast`**: Defines the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for the DSL. These Go structs represent the structure of an onboarding request.
- **`internal/ebnf`**: Contains the EBNF grammar for the S-expression DSL.
- **`internal/parse`**: The parser, built with the `participle` library, which transforms S-expression text into the Go AST.
- **`internal/print`**: Responsible for serializing the AST back into a formatted S-expression string.
- **`internal/generator`**: A powerful component that can generate a complete DSL instance from a template and a set of high-level inputs (client entities, products).
- **`internal/manager`**: The central component that ties together parsing, storage, and validation.
- **`internal/storage`**: A simple, versioned, file-based storage system for DSL documents.
- **`internal/mocks`**: A well-designed data loader for mock entities, products, and scenarios from JSON files, which is excellent for testing and development.

## Code Quality and Design

### Strengths

- **Well-Structured**: The project is organized logically. The separation of concerns is clear, with distinct packages for parsing, generation, storage, and the core AST.
- **Clean Code**: The Go code is generally clean, readable, and idiomatic.
- **DSL Abstraction**: The use of a `generator` is a major strength. It abstracts away the complexity of writing the S-expression DSL by hand, allowing for programmatic creation of onboarding requests.
- **Testability**: The `mocks` loader makes it easy to create and manage test data, which is a huge plus for a DSL-based system.
- **Extensibility**: The design allows for future extensions. New DSL features can be added by updating the AST, parser, and generator.

### Linter-Driven Improvements

We have integrated `golangci-lint` into the development process, which has helped us to identify and fix a number of issues, including:

- **Error Handling**: We have improved the error handling throughout the application, ensuring that all errors are properly checked and handled.
- **Code Style**: We have fixed a number of code style issues, making the code more consistent and readable.
- **Performance**: We have addressed several performance issues, such as pre-allocating slices to avoid unnecessary re-allocations.

### Areas for Improvement

- **Incomplete Features**: The `internal/planner` and `internal/validate` packages are currently placeholders. Implementing these would be the next logical step to add real business value (e.g., creating an executable plan from the DSL and validating it against business rules).
- **Hardcoded Logic**: The `internal/print/print.go` and parts of the `generator` contain some hardcoded logic (e.g., default lifecycle states, setup operations). This could be made more configurable, perhaps by moving this data to configuration files or a dedicated registry.

## Recommendations

1.  **Implement Core Logic**: Prioritize the implementation of the `planner` and `validate` packages. The planner is critical for making the DSL executable, and the validator is essential for ensuring the integrity of the onboarding requests.
2.  **Enhance Configuration**: Externalize the hardcoded logic in the generator and printer. This will make the application more flexible and easier to adapt to different onboarding scenarios.
3.  **Improve Error Reporting**: Enhance the error messages in the parser to include line and column numbers, and provide more specific details about what went wrong. This will significantly improve the developer experience when working with the DSL.

## Conclusion

The `dsl-go` project is a solid foundation for a powerful and flexible onboarding orchestration engine. The architecture is sound, and the code quality is high. By addressing the areas for improvement listed above, the project can evolve into a mature and robust application.
